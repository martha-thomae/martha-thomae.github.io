<h1>Martha E. Thomae</h1>

<p><b>Given name:</b> &nbsp;Martha Eladia María<br>
<b>Surname:</b> &emsp;&ensp;Thomae Elías</p>

<p>I have a PhD in Music Technology from McGill University, where I worked under the supervision 
  of Ichiro Fujinaga and Julie Cumming. 
  I have a Bachelor’s degree in Mathematics from Universidad del Valle de Guatemala 
  and a Master’s degree in Music Technology from McGill University. Since 2015, I have been 
  a member of the Single Interface for Music Score Searching and Analysis (SIMSSA) project 
  and the Centre for Interdisciplinary Research in Music Media and Technology (CIRMMT) at McGill, 
  serving as student coordinator of the Music Information Research axis of CIRMMT from 2017–2019.

<p>My research is focused on the preservation and encoding of mensural music. I have developed tools to 
  facilitate the encoding of this repertoire, including the <i>Mensural MEI Translator</i> and the 
  <i>Automatic Scoring-up Tool</i>, which I later integrated into the <i>Measuring Polyphony Editor</i> 
  (an online editor for mensural notation). 
  I am an active member of the Mensural MEI Interest Group (IG), where we look into the best options 
  for encoding the various features of mensural notation to represent the characteristics of the vocal 
  polyphonic music from the Late Middle Ages and the Renaissance. I served as Co-Chair of the Mensural MEI IG 
  (2020–2021) and member of the MEI Board (2020–2022). Currently, I am working on a project that involves the 
  digitization and encoding of the musical content of a Guatemalan choirbook from the colonial period which 
  is written in mensural notation. The project involved the taking digital images of this choirbook, using 
  optical music recognition (OMR) to retrieve the music symbols from said images, and automatically line-up 
  the voices and make editorial corrections with the help of computational music analysis tools. For more details,
