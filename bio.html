<h1>Martha E. Thomae</h1>

<p><b>Given name:</b> &nbsp;Martha Eladia María<br>
<b>Surname:</b> &emsp;&ensp;Thomae Elías</p>

<p>I am a postdoctoral research fellow for the ECHOES project at the NOVA University of Lisbon, where I work on developing tools to facilitate the search and analysis of chants encoded in the MEI music format.  
  I have a PhD in Music Technology from McGill University, where I worked under the supervision 
  of Ichiro Fujinaga and Julie Cumming. 
  I have a Bachelor’s degree in Mathematics from Universidad del Valle de Guatemala 
  and a Master’s degree in Music Technology from McGill University. I worked as a research assistant for the Single Interface for Music Score Searching and Analysis (SIMSSA) project at the Distributed Digital Musical Archives and Libraries (DDMAL) Lab, directed by Ichiro Fujinaga, at McGill; and was a member of the Centre for Interdisciplinary Research in Music Media and Technology (CIRMMT), 
  serving as student coordinator of the Music Information Research axis of CIRMMT from 2017–2019.

<p>My research is focused on the preservation and encoding of mensural music. I have developed tools to 
  facilitate the encoding of this repertoire, including the <i>Mensural MEI Translator</i> and the 
  <i>Automatic Scoring-up Tool</i>, which I later integrated into the <i>Measuring Polyphony Editor</i> 
  (an online editor for mensural notation). 
  I am an active member of the Mensural MEI Interest Group (IG), where we look into the best options 
  for encoding the various features of mensural notation to represent the characteristics of the vocal 
  polyphonic music from the Late Middle Ages and the Renaissance. I served as Co-Chair of the Mensural MEI IG 
  (2020–2021) and member of the MEI Board (2020–2022).</p>

<p>My PhD dissertation focused on digitizing and encoding Guatemalan polyphonic choirbooks from the colonial period, which are written in mensural notation, using optical music recognition, automatic voice alignment, and computational error detection.
