title: Guatemalan digitization project
---

The project involved the design of a DIY (do-it-yourself) book scanners, with their parts either built (book cradle) or borrowed (cameras and lights). The following videos show the book cradle configurations, the complete setup of the book scanner, and the steps followed during the digitization process. I hope this is useful for other archives and initiatives that want to take on a digitization project with large manuscripts or prints.

## Book Cradle Configurations:
The cradle was built by my father in Guatemala. It allows for two configurations:
1. [Upside V-shaped configuration](https://youtu.be/VDbJQSMjB0s)
2. [Open-at-one-side configuration](https://youtu.be/ULAE4sE2Wqg)

## Digitization Process
These videos show the process followed during digitization:
1. [The scanner setup used](https://youtu.be/zouvKiE6QYg)
2. [The steps in the digitization of each folio](https://youtu.be/4KFCom8Vndo)
3. [Decisions taken when reaching the other end of the book](https://youtu.be/cDn3b8RsQBM). When reaching the other end of the book, I needed to open it at a larger angle so that it didn't close abruptly and to raise the spine so that the curvature of the pages decreased.
