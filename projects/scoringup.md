# Measuring Polyphony editor (MP-editor)
## Description
An online mensural notation editor. My contribution to this editor was the scoring-up functionality. This implied converting my Python script into JavaScript, and introducing functionality to deal with older mensural repertoire (Ars antiqua) among other things.
